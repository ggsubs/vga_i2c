# VGA I2C GPIO + Atari 2600 Joystick Extender

This is a little VGA-to-VGA board that adds an I2C GPIO expander to the DDC/CI I2C lines of the VGA cable and 
then connects those GPIOs to 2 Atari 2600 joystick ports.

It also adds 4 more switches and 2 LEDs.

**The board has been sent out for production, but hasn't been tested yet!**

This is my first PCB ever, so use caution if you copy this!
